# JMH benchmarks

This repository contains loosely related benchmark and implementations for posts at <https://blog.argosware.com>. The blog posts are the documentation.

Code appears here before the blog posts. If you want explanation for something, write me and I may give a quick explanation or make the post earlier.

**DO NOT COPY & PASTE THIS INTO PRODUCTION. IF YOU DO, <inst>GREAT PAIN AND SUFFERING WILL FOLLOW YOU FOR ALL ETERNITY</ins>**

Most code here is only useful in very specific use cases.
